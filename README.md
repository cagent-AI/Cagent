# Cagent

**Cagent** is an open-source Python framework designed to let you deploy your own agents, powered by OpenAI, Anthropic, and EternalAI LLMs.  
Cagent is built from a modularized version of the Zerebro backend. With Cagent, you can launch your own agent with similar core functionality as Zerebro. For creative outputs, you'll need to fine-tune your own model.
